#Abstract Vector spaces

(v, +, *), a set of objects V
- needs to know how to add objects
- how to scale objects

Properties to hold:
- Distribute: c(v_1 + v_2) = cv_1 + cv_2
- Commutative: v_1 + v_2 = v_2 + v_1

e.g. (R3, + , *). Objects are [a b c]
- Adding [a1 b1 c1] and [a2 b2 c2]: [a1+a2 b1+b2 c1+c2] 
- Scale:
